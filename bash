JSON Structure
The editor supports both flat and Dashboard structures:
Flat Structure (Legacy):
json{
  "Announcements": {
    "Default": { "Text": "...", "Details": "...", "Links": [] },
    "Targeted": []
  },
  "Support": { "Text": "...", "Links": [] }
}
Dashboard Structure (New):
json{
  "Dashboard": {
    "Announcements": { ... },
    "Support": { ... }
  }
}
üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations
GitHub Token Security

Never commit tokens to repositories
Tokens are stored in browser memory only (not saved to disk)
Use tokens with minimum required permissions ("repo" scope)
Rotate tokens regularly
For Enterprise: Enable SSO and MFA

Browser Storage

Auto-save uses localStorage (stays on local machine)
Clear auto-save data after publishing: Done automatically
Use HTTPS when hosting on web servers
