Troubleshooting
The icon is missing from my system tray
Solution: The icon may be in the hidden icons area.

Click the ^ (up arrow) in your system tray
Look for the Lincoln Laboratory logo
Drag the icon to your main taskbar to keep it visible


I can't install driver updates - "AC Power Required" message
Solution: Driver updates require your laptop to be plugged into AC power.

Connect your laptop to its power adapter
Wait a few seconds for Windows to recognize AC power
Try the driver update again


The dashboard shows "No announcements at this time"
Possible Causes:

You may be on VPN or off-network when the app starts
Network connectivity issues

Solutions:

Right-click the icon and select "Refresh Now"
Ensure you're connected to the network (on-site or via GlobalProtect VPN)
If the issue persists, restart the application or contact IT Support


Driver update button doesn't appear
This is normal! The driver update button only appears when:

It has been 30+ days since the last driver update
Driver updates have never been run on your computer

If drivers were recently updated, you'll see the status "Last run X days ago" and no button will appear.

"Pending Restart Status" shows but I just restarted
Solution: Windows sometimes requires multiple restarts after updates.

Restart your computer again
The status should clear after the restart completes
If the message persists after 2-3 restarts, contact IT Support
