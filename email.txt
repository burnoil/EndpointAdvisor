Subject: Introducing LLNOTIFY – A New Way to Receive ISD Updates

Dear Team,

We’re rolling out a new desktop messaging tool called LLNOTIFY to help improve how we deliver important updates from the ISD team.

What is LLNOTIFY?
LLNOTIFY is a lightweight, real-time notification tool that runs in your system tray. It allows us to send timely, high-priority announcements directly to your desktop, ensuring you never miss critical information—without interrupting your work.

You’ll notice a small icon appear in your system tray. When a message is sent, you’ll see a discreet notification with the information and any necessary action steps.

Here’s what it looks like in action:

(Example: a notification message displayed near the bottom-right corner of your screen)

We’d love your feedback!
As one of our initial users, your input is important. Please take a moment to let us know how the tool is working for you or if you experience any issues. Just reply to this email with your thoughts.

Thank you for your support as we continue improving how we communicate across the organization.

Best regards,
